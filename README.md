# Culex_Biting_RNAseq

This workflow will identify differentially expressed genes in two Culex mosquito groups, non-biting and biting lines, to help elucidate underlying genes and metabolic pathways associated with obligate non-biting. 

Notes about the workflow for sequence analysis can be found in [MasterNotes.md](https://github.com/srmarzec/Culex_Biting_RNAseq/blob/main/MasterNotes.md)
