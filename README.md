# Giardia_mucusRNA_Analysis

This workflow will identify differentially expressed genes in three _Giardia_. lamblia (WB) groups, which are _Giardia_ cultured in the control media (non-viscoelastic), the xanthan gum media (viscoelastic), and the methylcellulose media (viscoelastic), to help elucidate underlying genes and metabolic pathways associated with viscoelastic growth condition that is comparable to the _in vivo_ mucus environment. 

Notes about the workflow for sequence analysis can be found in [MasterNotes.md](https://github.com/sl1453/Giardia_mucusRNA_Analysis/blob/main/MasterNotes.md)
